# Spotistats

Spotistats is a data analysis and visualization project based on personal Spotify streaming history. Spotify is one of the most famous and popular music streaming platforms. This project aims to explore and analyze the user's Spotify usage to gain useful insights into their listening habits.

In this project, we will explore various aspects of Spotify usage data, including:
- The list of songs played
- The list of artists of the songs
- The duration of usage and more

The dataset used here showcases the personal usage of Spotify, downloaded from Spotify's Privacy Setting section, which allows anyone to download their personal usage data.
