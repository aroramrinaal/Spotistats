# Spotistats

Spotistats is a data analysis and visualization project based on personal Spotify streaming history. Spotify is one of the most famous and popular music streaming platforms. This project aims to explore and analyze the user's Spotify usage to gain useful insights into their listening habits.

In this project, we will explore various aspects of Spotify usage data, including:
- The list of songs played
- The list of artists of the songs
- The duration of usage and more

The dataset used here showcases the personal usage of Spotify, downloaded from Spotify's Privacy Setting section, which allows anyone to download their personal usage data.

- **Jupyter Notebook**: An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
- **Python**: A powerful programming language known for its readability and vast library support.
- **Libraries**:
  - `numpy`: A library for numerical computations.
  - `pandas`: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
  - `matplotlib`: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
  - `seaborn`: A statistical data visualization library based on matplotlib.
  - `wordcloud`: A library for generating word clouds from text.
